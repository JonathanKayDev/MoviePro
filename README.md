# Movie Pro

Movie Pro is an app which demonstrates both retrieving and storing data from an API. Movie information from various categories are retrieved directly from TMDB (e.g. upcoming, now playing), and a select few having been stored in a SQL database, which then form my custom collections.

The app was built with ASP.NET MVC, C# and SQL, and utilises a role-based security system which restricts access to certain pages and actions. The designated Admin users can import movie data from the TMDB API, create, and edit custom movie collections. A demo Admin account login is provided so that visitors can view the pages only accessible to a site administrator, however persistent CRUD operations cannot be undertaken in the demo account.

The front end was developed with HTML, JavaScript, CSS and Bootstrap, using a bootstrap template as a starting point. The backend utilises MVC and C#, with a PostgreSQL database hosted on Heroku. Heroku is a platform as service (PaaS) that enables developers to run and operate applications in the cloud.
